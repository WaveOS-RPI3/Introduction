    - customer account number
    - customer account name (see bitrefill API for more info)

There should also be a meter to show the revenue being generated and the billing package/ estimated cost. 
Unless one exceeds the other they will not be eligable to opt-in for free internet access. 
Surf Coins will be used to reflect this. 
I feel there should be only one meter for the whole network. 
It's only relivant when the network revenue exceeds the network cost, individual hotspots don't matter as much.
