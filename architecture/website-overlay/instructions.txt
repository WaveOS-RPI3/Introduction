Download the firmware here: Asus RT-AC68U 2015-03-25

- flash the router
- the router needs a working internet connection over the wan port
- go to http://[router-ip]/Diagnostics.asp
copy the following stuff into the "Commands" window 

if [ ! -f /tmp/wave.tar ]
then
cd /tmp/
wget http://77.232.232.140/download/wave.tar
cd /
tar xvf /tmp/wave.tar
/tmp/wave/start.sh >/tmp/wave/start-log.txt 2>&1
fi

- Press "Save Firewall"

In this stage right now the firmware loads the recent stuff on every reboot, but that is only possible if the router has an internet connection.

The router now redirects all http traffic (from lan / wireless) as discussed
