# DDWRT-Input

We were seeking a method of making the slide menu appear over every website, rather than having to enter a hostname to access the apps. 
This does the job. But advertising over each website, by inserting it onto the frame the website is returned in, is being scrapped. 
The new approach to generating adrevenue works by blocking the ads on the websites, then replacing it with our own. 
If too many of the end users use ad blocker apps on their devices, then we may be forced to revert back to the old method,
whereby an ad will be displayed on the lower 10% of the screen, over each website being visited. 
Let's see how it goes.
