**The First Single Board Computer (SBC) Operating System for Regular People/ Non-Programmers**

Here are some of the benefits of WaveOS: 

**Internet Speed Boosting**

**Media Library**

Using the absolute latest technologies from [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net), [Squid3](https://squidproxy.org) & [Bind9](https://wiki.debian.org/Bind9) to make your internet around x5 times faster

Todays most powerful Media Library is [Emby](https://emby.media), it turns your movies and music into your own personal Netflix. It even automatically locates subtitled & audio in all languages

**Smart Home Control**

**Cameras (IPCCTV)**

The cutting edge of smart home control from [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org). Gives users Wi-Fi control of everything surrounding them e.g. Air Conditioning, Lights, Locks etc

IP Cameras made very simple with [MotionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki). This is by far the fastest and easiest solution, to get started with your IP Cameras

**Energy Monitoring**

**HD IPTV(+ EPG)**

[EmonCMS](https://emoncms.org) transforms the way we view & manage our energy consumption/  production, with sharp and visually stunning graphs

Since the Wave Hotspot boosts your internet speed so well, it's now possible to stream HD Satellite TV from any Country in the World with just 1Mbps of speed

**Display Mirroring**

**Remote Access**

In 'Extender Mode' Wave can be displayed on multiple devices simultaniously, permitting one device to control other in any combination.

In 'Hotspot Mode' Wave has Remote Access - granting users unlimited access to a single dashboard which can monitor and control your entire home or business 24/7

Wave must be hosted on a Single Board Computer (SBC), so you should order one before proceeding

A pack of 7 is the recommended number of units for the ultimate WaveOS smart home experience.  

e.g. connect 1 onto your router (mandatory) and the remainder onto devices you wish to monitor & control e.g. TV's/ Solar Inverter. Two can also pair together to extend Wi-Fi

* _all cables, PSU & WaveOS pre-installer SD Cards included_

Plug & Play _(skip the manual installation process)_

use [Win32 DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) to burn WaveOS to your Micro SD Card

**Step-2.** **Set your Router **

WaveOS currently requires you to adjust a setting on your routers subnet e.g. Gateway and DHCP IP. We are working to eliminate this step in later versions of Wave, but for now it's mandator 

 Login

Update subnet

Save & Reboot

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRwtjngMAUCFAGnzjW8TpjE58IFeU4lre0zgAH5FrfeCkwGNNgp)

Enter your router IP into the address bar to access its menu

[How-to-Guide](https://www.linksys.com/us/support-article?articleNum=132891)

Gateway: 10.0.0.1

DHCP: 10.0.0.2 - 10.0.0.254

[How-to Guide](https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/7571856?hl=en)

The LED indicator will say when the reboot has completed

_\* It is also recommended, once up and running with Wave, that you disable your old routers Wi-Fi and use only the Wave Hotspot_

**Step-3.** **Plug & Play**

Fairly obvious but the sequence is important 

Insert SD Card

  Connect to Router

Connect Power

![](http://iuniker.com/Uploads/Products/20171110/5a0543fa71858.jpg)

Insert the WaveOS Micro SD Card into the SBC Device

 Connect your device to your Wi-Fi Router with the ethernet cable.

Power up the device 

\* during boot-up (for the first time only) Wave will connect to our code source and self-configure some essential services like updates & upgrades, the Wi-Fi and the set-up Menu. This process can take up to 15 minutes depending on internet speed

**Step-4.** **Set-Up Wizard (Mode Select Menu)**

Fairly obvious step, but the sequence is important

Connect

Access Menu

Select a Mode

In Hotspot Mode Wave creates a new Wi-Fi Station with Faster Internet Speeds. Wave's Menu & Apps can be also accessed from any device connected to the Hotspot (by simply typing 'Wave' into the web browser)

In Extender Mode Wave displays its Menu & Apps on any HDMI connected display. Typing 'Wave' into your mobiles web browser will also allow you to select and control the display.

**Energy-Mode**

**Repeater-Mode**

 Receiver

Receiver / Transmitter

Ethernet

 Wireless

 ![](https://image.ibb.co/mCwTay/inverter_mode.png)

![](https://image.ibb.co/jNSWTJ/repeater_mode.png)

In Energy Mode your device will collect data from your Solar Inverter which can be used to autonomously reduce your energy costs e.g. as your battery level falls below 90% your high consumption devices can all turn off automatically, subsequently extending your battery life by as much as 10 years

In repeater mode your device will interface with a secondary unit (also in repeater mode) to extend your Wi-Fi by as much as 25 Meters. The extenders also feature technologies to speed up your extended internet in the process. 

\* 1 Unit in Hotspot-Mode must exist (first & always)

\* the mode-select menu can also be accessed via the web browser of any mobile device connected to the Modeless Hotspot
