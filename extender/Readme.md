The Extender is a Wi-Fi receiver to HDMI, 
to allow your Wave Hotspot Menu to appear on multiple devices around your home or business. 

In order to control the extender, you simple enter 'wave' into your mobiles web-browser, visit the smart home control section and if not already added, 
add the device you wish to control. 

The way the extenders work, is it brings up the Wave menu as it would appear on any device.
It's basically Google Chrome in Kiosk mode with the default splash page set to 'wave'

The extenders have Guacamole installed, which allows you to mirror the device to another device.
