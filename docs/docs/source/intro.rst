Introduction
============

Who am I?
----------

I'm Sion Buckler, ex British Forces, a Life Member of the Royal Signals and a British Public Servant in Oath until 2024. My engineering background is extensive, both in education and experience. I hold diplomas in Industrial Electronics, Electronic Engineering, CCNA, MCSE and specialist IT including the programming telephone exchanges & satellites (Siemens), full spectrum radio communications and computer programming/ Pen Testing (Java & Shell Script, Linux, HTML/CSS, Ajax, JQuery etc). Everything I've learned has been home school, classroom (trade training) and from the internet with 15+ years experience on various projects for clients including Fujitsu, Santander and even Google. 

The pinnacle of all my knowledge is now being invested into Wave: my own Free & Open Source Operating System, designed to make any Single Board Computer a Plug & Play Smart Home Hub which makes internet and energy Freer and/or completely free. The solution features some great open source and free apps for the end-users e.g. IPTV/ Media Center, IPCCTV DVR, IoT Smart Home Control, Vehicle Tracking and Energy Monitoring - All autonomously installed and configured during initial installation, which is also automous. Wave simply copies onto a Micro SD card, inserts into any Single Board Computer connected to the internet and within minutes can be used, enjoyed and benefitted from. 

What this guide is about
----------------------------

This guide cover several topics relating to WaveOS. The main areas of these guides are:

* End-User Guide
* Distributor Guide (Growing a Global Network)
* Developer Guide (Source Code, Version Control, API etc)

Disclaimer
----------

Keep in mind that although I am a profesional engineer with extensive background experience and education, this is the first product of this magnitude I have attempted to develop, the work is ongoing and as of 2018 I am still in the early phases and some time away from a final solution. There is much I have yet to learnt about best practices for Documenting, Open Source Code & Version Control and Systems Integration of the various technologies included in this new Operating System. There are industry standard methodologies this new Operating System is yet to adhear to - I remain humble and open to suggestions at all levels. 

Everything you find here at this stage is without waranty and I accept not responsible for any inconveniences or issues that might occur as a result of use of this new Operating System: WaveOS. As time goes on I can only assure you that less Single Board Computers and Memory Sticks become damaged and/or 'bricked' by WaveOS. Fortunately both are low cost hardware and WaveOS is free, so it's feasible fun and promising technology right now, to say the least. 

Some Remarks
------------

When I feel that some topic is covered solidly somewhere else, I will
redirect you there. So think about this also as summary of available materials.

Somewhere is necessary to know some basics about Linux and terminal. I'll try to remark them.
 
Sometimes I might be improper in explaining some terms or details. This might be mainly because of two reasons:

1. I don't understand a subject enough to explain it better  
2. It's not necessary you to know it for our purpose

I hope I'll be able to explain all things somehow *human-likely*. If you want to know technical details, just find them on your own :) .

On GitHub repository of this `guide <https://GitHub.com/unclehowell/WaveOS>`_ you can find all the latest source code for WaveOS. 

Languages
-----------

The primary language of WaveOS will be English. Secondary languages will be introduced using translators which will use the English literature as the primary source of information. 

Feedback
--------

I'll be really happy for you feedback - don't hesitate to ask about some additional info or next guides and also if you find some mistakes, please let me know. Both can be done by submitting an issue on git hub, where are these guides placed.
