Introduction
============

Who am I?
----------

I'm Sion Buckler, ex British Forces, a Life Member of the Royal Signals and a British Public Servant in Oath until 2024. My engineering background is extensive, both in education and experience. Begining with study of diplomas in Industrial Electronics, Electronic Engineering and moving onto Networking (CCNA, MCSE etc) then Cyber Warfare (programming telephone exchanges, satellites, full spectrum radios, Pen Testing and Source Code).

Everything I've learned has been in a classroom, on the internet and from years of experience on various projects for clients like Fujitsu, Santander and even Google. The pinnacle of all my knowledge is now being invested into Wave: my own Operating System which is intended to make any Single Board Computer a Plug & Play Smart Home Hub which is capable of offering a Smart Home Solution so intelligent it makes internet and energy Freer and/or completely free. In addition to some cool apps such as a IPTV/ Media Center, IPCCTV DVR, IoT Smart Home Control, Vehicle Tracking and Energy Monitoring.

The main areas of these guides are:

* End-User
* Distributors and Resellers
* Developers

Disclaimer
----------

Keep in mind that I am a profesional engineer however this is the first product I have developed and the work on it is ongoing. 
I myself have an extensive engineering background, but the latest practices for Documentation, Source Code and some other expectations of this day and age are still new to me. However, from what I can gather these methodologies are wise to impliment and I remain open to suggestions as the project moves forward. 

Everything you find here is without waranty and I accept not responsible for any inconveniences or issues that might occur as a result of use of this new Operating System: WaveOS. 

Some remarks
------------

When I feel that some topic is covered solidly somewhere else, I will
redirect you there. So think about this also as summary of available materials.

Somewhere is necessary to know some basics about Linux and terminal. I'll try to remark them.
 
Sometimes I might be improper in explaining some terms or details. This might be mainly because of two reasons:

1. I don't understand a subject enough to explain it better  
2. It's not necessary you to know it for our purpose

I hope I'll be able to explain all things somehow *human-likely*. If you want to know technical details, just find them on your own :) .

On GitHub repository of this `guide <https://GitHub.com/unclehowell/WaveOS>`_ you can find all the latest source code for WaveOS. 

One extremely important remark - **USE GOOGLE**!

My English
-----------

I'm Welsh and all my basic education was actually done in Welsh, techically English is my second language, but I've spoken and written in English much of my life and my level of education is high enough that there should be no issues with ability to convey information in English. 

Feedback
--------

I'll be really happy for you feedback - don't hesitate to ask about some additional info or next guides and also if you find some mistakes, please let me know.

Both can be done by submitting an issue on git hub, where are these guides placed.
