**Disclaimer**: Even though this guide was written with up-to-date software (bleeding edge like), it is starting to be obsolete. `systemd` has been undergoing huge changes and there might be even easier solutions or the ones in the *tutos* are not available anymore. Please keep this in mind when reading the tutorial!

This repository is for tutorials and guides about Archlinux in general and also about Archlinux ARM on RPi specific configuration. 

Configs are "as they is" in my machines (Archlinux laptop or RPi) and I just changed some "sensitive" informations in it (like real domain) etc.

If you find out some mistakes, find something really confusing or you'd like to hear more about some specific topic, don't hesitate to submit an issue. I'll do my best to satisfy you.
