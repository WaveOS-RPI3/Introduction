The master server is where each device connected to the network will look to in order to update EPG guide data and other centralised information points
This server will also be an interactive demo, for use on the webpage.
Unlike the Hotspots or the Extenders, the Server will exclude dietpi and will instead be built upon Debian 9. 
In the event the server is lost, this folder will host the source code required to autonommously get the interactive demo and server live again.
