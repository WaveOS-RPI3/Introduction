# Cross Device Scripts

This area is for scripts which will be used across all the device modes 

For example the intial menu (with the selector of what mode you wish to operate the technology in) will be retrieved from this folder. 
The scripts will try not to do anything too bespoke, but instead pull in the repositories and make tiny alternations and fixes to suit the needs of the WaveOS.
