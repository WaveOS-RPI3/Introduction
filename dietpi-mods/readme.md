Once the latest DietPi has been burned to the SD Card, select the Folder that has the Gateway address of the Router you plan to connect your Wave Hotspot too, then copy the dietpi.txt file to the SD Card (overwriting the default dietpi.txt file on it) 

Now, when you first boot, your Wave Hotspot will connect to the internet and complete the installation using the internet. 

This is for purposes of speeding up the assembly phase, specifically writing to the SD Card.
Now it's possible to write a light-weight OS to the SD card, overwrite one or two files then complete initial set-up using full-autonomy. 

This can be done by the customer, but it is designed for the assemblers of the product.
